GDG Ogbomoso is growing its ecosystem, so we intend to introduce our community members to  Flutter.

The facilitator will share his wealth of experience in the workshop "Building your first flutter App"

The goal is to drive Flutter's interest to the community members before we organize different meet-ups or Codelabs.
